        Sports have always seemed to be a large part of my life either as an
        athlete participating or as a fan. I was raised in a very sports-
        oriented environment. My father was still a young man when I was
        born.
        He was very athletic and as a child, I went with him as he played
        fast-pitch softball, softball, basketball and sometimes was allowed
        to go to the golf course with him. As I recall, all of these
        activities were held at public parks and recreation centers. I think
        my brother and I got our competitiveness directly from our dad. None
        of us are sore losers, but we love to win and hate to lose.

        I remember one occasion at the local recreation center where my dad
        and his buddies played softball and basketball regularly. On this
        particular night, they were playing some hotly contested pick-up
        basketball games and I ran all over the rec. center as the night
        wore on. I was probably 5 years old and my mom had stayed home that
        night.
        This obviously allowed me quite a bit of freedom as my dad played
        ball. Near the end of the night, my dad and another player got into
        a little scrap. A little fighting was not all that dangerous back in
        1970. This was not uncommon and would usually end up with the two
        combatants shaking hands and later having a beer together. I
        remember being worried as I watched the scuffle. Afterwards,
        everyone started playing again so I wandered on off to play in the
        center. After what seemed like a long time, I entered the gym and to
        my amazement, it was completely empty. I ran to the lobby of the
        center and the doors were locked and I saw no cars in the parking
        lot. It wasn't very long before the man that worked at the center
        unlocked the front doors and my dad was with him.

        We returned to the golf course in time to watch the opening kick-off
        on T.V. and soon returned all of our &quot;borrowed&quot; items. The
        failure of that plan still pains me today.
